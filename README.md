run the code and you will get that table file you want
the code works like this:
1. Download the file and unzip. If file already exist, then don't download
2. According to the README.txt, read the data and assign to variables all features.
3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
6. From the data set in in the previous step, create another independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each 
   activity and each subject. Then output the table

I believe I've made the variable names in the output table pretty self-explanatory. (To be honest, asking me to explain all 88 variables is ridiculous.)
